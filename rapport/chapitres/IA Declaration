\chapter*{Declaration on the Use of Generative Artificial Intelligence}

\vspace{0.5cm}
We hereby affirm having utilized generative artificial intelligence (GAI) tools in a limited 
and responsible way while working on this project:

\vspace{0.3cm}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Text reformulation and punctuation correction}: We used "ChatGPT" to rephrase and polish some sections of the report,
    namely to enhance clarity, punctuation, and stylistic consistency. All content produced was derived from our original work and was thoroughly 
    checked and, where needed, altered to guarantee its accuracy and originality.
    
    \vspace{0.2cm}
    \item \textbf{Code debugging and optimization}: We used "Claud 3.5" and "DeepSeek" as development assistants to identify potential bugs and suggest enhancements to the design and logic of our code. 
    All suggestions provided by these tools were thoroughly checked and adjusted to meet the specific needs of our application.
    
    \vspace{0.2cm}
    \item \textbf{Technical translation assistance}: ChatGPT was also used to translate specific technical terms or short phrases between French and English, in order to ensure accurate terminology
    within the report.
\end{enumerate}

\vspace{0.4cm}
\par These GAI tools were used strictly as only support technologies to enhance the clarity, quality, and functionality of our work.
When it comes to core research, writing, and problem-solving processes they were certainly and entirely carried out and validated by us.
